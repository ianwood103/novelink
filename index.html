            With NoveLink, struggling new authors can finally make a name for themselves
            without having to get accepted by increasingly picky publishing companies.
            Users of NoveLink don't have to be authors themselves, as they can also use
            it to find new works of literature of their own and directly support their
            favorite authors, all for <b> free. </b>

          <p class="blurb">
            As an author, the most important path to success is getting your works
            to your fans. However, adequate publishing deals can often be a long term
            time commitment and many new authors find themselves unable to get their
            career as an author going. With NoveLink, anyone who wants to publish their
            own works of literature can, with a one time payment of one dollar. This
            payment of one dollar not only goes towards supporting NoveLink but also
            makes sure all authors of NoveLink are at least somewhat serious about
            creating quality literature.

            Through NoveLink, fans of a particular NoveLink creator can follow their
            future projects and establish a 'feed' of sorts. This feed will include
            all of the author's works published on NoveLink, which a fan can access
            directly through the site completely for free. Fans can also directly
            donate to their favorite authors to support their career even more.
            NoveLink, however, is not completely limited to smaller authors that
            are looking to gain an audience, but it is also encouraged for already
            well-established authors to use the site to directly communicate with fans.

            Using NoveLink, fans of a particular group of authors, genre, or topic
            within literature can create writers' guilds. These guilds can serve as
            a themed discussion area in which multiple fans can easily communicate
            with eachother. Guilds can even create their own flags and raise funds
            to donate to certain authors within NoveLink. The more money a guild
            donates and the more members it has can give it special status, and can
            be featured on the Top Guilds page.
